this isle, as I am a good Christian, and, what is
more, a good Christian man’s son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stephano.</span> Bottle me no bottles, Trinculo.
Had we ne’er shared a bottle betwixt us we had not
been left to bide by ourselves in this whoreson isle in
the hard service of the man-monster, Caliban, but
might be in fair Naples at this very hour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trinculo.</span> Sagely said, Master Stephano.
Thou wast ever wise enow i’ the tail o’ the event.
An’ thou could’st have looked it thus wisely i’ the
mouth, thou hadst been a made man, Stephano, a
made man, and a householder, to boot.

King to give us over to a dog’s life in this heathen
isle with a man-monster for a master, and none
other company beside.</p>

thine, most sage <span class="smcap">Stephano.</span> Thou art indeed become
a second Socrates for sober conclusions.</p>

some food, I say, or thy bones shall pay thy
jape. Get thee hence at once, for a mighty hunger

for a stony-hearted cur! Why but now there met
us two distressed females weeping their hearts out
at their eyes, and sighing, moreover, as ’twould
move a very Turk to pity, and yet this cur took
no more note on ’t than they had been two sticks
or stones. Why, the Woman of Samaria would
have plucked out her hair in pity of the twain,
nay, so would I have done the same in her stead,—yet
what say I, for there’s not so much hair on
my head as my mother’s brass kettle has of its
cover. A vengeance on ’t, now where was I? O,
truly, I was e’en at the Woman of Samaria. Now,
good sirs, and gentles all, the Woman of Samaria
had for ruth plucked out her hair, but
did not my dog Crab, who by your leaves is as
hairy a dog as goes on one-and-twenty toes, shed
even one hair in sorrow for the twain: not e’en the
smallest hair on ’s nose. And the matter of the
meeting was on this wise. This small stone, with
the crack in ’t, is the maid, she with the flowers; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
I think there be a crack in her wits, but no matter
for that; this stone, a something bigger, ay, and
with a crack in ’t, too, shall be the lady with her
hair all unbound; this tree shall be the dog; nay,
that’s not so neither, for I am the tree and the tree
is me, and this stick is the dog, and thus it is.
Now doth the small stone weep as ’twere a fountain
gone astray, and may not speak for weeping;
now doth the something bigger stone weep too, yet
with a difference, and she doth not speak for weeping
either, and truly I did weep likewise and no
more could speak for my weeping than the poor
distressed females might, yet there came all the while
no word of comfort from this dog’s mouth, not
even one tear from his lids. Pray God, gentles all,
there be no such hard hearts among any of you,
or ’twere ten thousand pities. ’Tis an ill thing to
have a sour nature like my dog Crab’s, and no
good comes on ’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tubal.</span> How now, Shylock! What bitter woe
looks from thy face? What has chanced to thee
in the Christian’s court to make thee thus distraught?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shylock.</span> O Tubal, Tubal, there dwells no
more pity in the Christian breast than there abides
justice therein. I stood for justice and mine own,
before them all; before that smiling, smooth-faced
judge from Padua, and with those false smiles of
his he turned against me the sharp edge of the
law. He forbade the shedding of one drop of the
merchant Antonio’s blood—naming therefor some
ancient law, musty for centuries, and that still had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
gathered dust till it would serve to bait the Jew
with—and so I lost my revenge upon Antonio.
More than that, good Tubal, I lost everything I
had to lose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tubal.</span> Lost everything! Now, by our ancient
prophets, this is woe indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shylock.</span> Aye, good Tubal. The half my
goods are now adjudged Antonio’s; the other half,
upon my death, goes to the knave, Lorenzo; that
same he that lately stole my ducats and my daughter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tubal.</span> And merry havoc will he and thy
daughter Jessica make of thy treasure, Shylock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shylock.</span> But there is greater woe to come,
good Tubal. To save this poor remainder of a
life have I this day sworn to turn a Christian.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tubal.</span> Thou, turn Christian! O monstrous
deed! Our synagogue will be put to everlasting
shame for this. Nay, good Shylock, it must not
be. It must not be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shylock.</span> Have I not said that I am sworn on
pain of life? They would e’en have had my life
almost in the open court had I not so sworn. But
hear me, Tubal; I will not die till that I have bethought
me of some secret, sure revenge upon
Antonio, or failing this, upon the taunting, sneering
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
fool they call Gratiano, whom I do loathe e’en
as I loathe Antonio. Moreover I would gladly do
some deadly hurt unto the accursed Paduan judge,
an’ it might be so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tubal.</span> Then wilt thou still be Hebrew at the
heart, good Shylock?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shylock.</span> How else while yet I bear remembrance
of my wrongs? Have not many of our
chosen people done this selfsame thing for ducats
or for life? Kissed the cross before men’s eyes,
but spurned it behind their backs? As I shall do,
erewhile. But, O good Tubal, the apples of
Sodom were as sweet morsels in the mouth unto this
that I must do.</p>

<h3>
NOTE BY WILLIAM J. ROLFE, <abbr title="Doctor of Literature"><span class="smcap">Litt.D.</span></abbr><br>
</h3>
</div>


<p>It is a tribute of no slight significance to
Shakespeare’s skill in the delineation of character
that we instinctively regard the personages in
his mimic world as real men and women, and are
not satisfied to think of them only as they appear
on the stage. We like to follow them after they
have left the scene, and to speculate concerning
their subsequent history. The commentators on
<cite>Much Ado</cite>, for instance, are not willing to dismiss
Benedick and Beatrice when the play closes without
discussing the question whether they probably
“lived happily ever after.” Some, like Mrs. Jameson
and the poet Campbell, have their misgivings
about the future of the pair, fearing that “poor
Benedick” will not escape the “predestinate
scratched face” which he himself had predicted for
the man who should woo and win that “infernal
Até in good apparel,” as he called her; while others,
like Verplanck, Charles Cowden-Clarke, Furnivall,
and Gervinus, believe that their married life
will be of “the brightest and sunniest.”</p>

<p>Some have gone back of the beginning of the
plays, like Mrs. Cowden-Clarke in her <cite>Girlhood of
Shakespeare’s Heroines</cite>, and Lady Martin (Helena
Faucit) in her paper on Ophelia in <cite>Some of
Shakespeare’s Female Characters</cite>.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
Others, like Mr. Adams, have made the experiment
of continuing a play of Shakespeare in dramatic
form. Ernest Renan, in France, and Mr.
C. P. Cranch, in this country, have both done this
in the case of <cite>The Tempest</cite>, mainly with the view
of following out the possible adventures of Caliban
after Prospero had left him to his own devices.</p>

<p>These and similar sequels to the plays are nowise
meant as attempts to “improve” Shakespeare
(like Nahum Tate’s version of <cite>Lear</cite>, that held the
stage for a hundred and sixty years) and sundry
other perversions of the plays in the eighteenth
century, which have damned their presumptuous
authors to everlasting infamy. They are what
Renan, in his preface, calls his <cite>Caliban</cite>,—“an
idealist’s fancy sketch, a simple fantasy of the
imagination.”</p>

<p>Mr. Adams’s Sixth Act of <cite>The Merchant of
Venice</cite> is an experiment of the same kind; not, as
certain captious critics have regarded it, a foolhardy
attempt to rival Shakespeare. It was originally
written for an evening entertainment of the
“Old Cambridge Shakespeare Association.” No
one in that cultivated company misunderstood the
author’s aim, and all heartily enjoyed it. I believe
